        We are a group of professionals,
        including a couple of attorneys, a
        music teacher, a psychological
        counselor..., and we have all been playing music in
        and around Nashville most of our lives.
        
       <p>
        We play a lot of soul, blues, jazz, 
        some pop oldies and a bit of country. The sax, B3/piano,
        and guitar give us range, and four of
        the players are also voc 	alists, so there
        is a lot of singing.
       
        <p>
        We're flexible,
        dependable, and we enjoy playing
        early shows. We are doing this because we love it.
        Give us a shot, we're confident you'll like what you hear!
